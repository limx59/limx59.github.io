  abstract = {[Objective] This paper introduces an edge scheduling mechanism of UPF based on a programmable network which realizes unified scheduling of the network element function and UPF in the open-source network operating system. This method aims to sink the UPF to the edge open network equipment, forming the integration of UPF network elements and the programmable network in the edge scenario. Most of the existing network devices provide only limited network access methods and network functions and fail to satisfy the diverse needs of edge scenarios. [Methods] Starting from the SONiC, which is the mainstream open-source network operation, based on the container technology to realize the scheduling capabilities of network functions and the integration method of UPF, the cloud-native way to realize the integration of resource scheduling scheme of SONiC and UPF is explained. [Results] Based on this solution, the UPF is sinking to the programmable network device for unified scheduling and management in the edge scenario. The feasibility analysis of the mechanism is done. [Limitations] As the overall technical architecture of UPF edge scheduling based on programmable networks, it realizes the deployment and scheduling of UPF network elements on the edge side network equipment. How to realize remote management and how to build a deterministic network and achieve cloud-side collaborative computing resource management through this solution are still open issues to be solved. [Conclusions] The UPF edge dispatching scheme based on the programmable network can be widely used in the Internet of Things, Internet of Vehicles, smart cities, and other fields, further enhancing openness and computing power dispatching ability of the network on the edge side, and solving the edge-side practical problems such as lack of network connectivity and computing power faced by the intelligent industry.},

  abstract = {With the development of computing power network technology, it has further promoted the further integration of cloud and network. The introduction of cloud-native and other information cloud computing technologies has enabled the computing power network to be open to the upper-layer services. Combined with the latest cloud-native serverless model, this paper proposes a FaaS-oriented scheduling technology of computing network heterogeneous resource, puts forward an overall technical architecture and a heterogeneous computing power scheduling mechanism, and further proposes an overall platform functional architecture on this basis. Thus, it solves the problem that the ability of computing network is further open to the upper application through FaaS under the condition of heterogeneous computing network integration.}

The computing power scheduling mechanism based on the programmable network solves the current bottleneck of network parameters that cannot be achieved in the current computing power scheduling process, which can better achieve the integration of network and computing power.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
