  abstract = {[Objective] This paper introduces an edge scheduling mechanism of UPF based on a programmable network which realizes unified scheduling of the network element function and UPF in the open-source network operating system. This method aims to sink the UPF to the edge open network equipment, forming the integration of UPF network elements and the programmable network in the edge scenario. Most of the existing network devices provide only limited network access methods and network functions and fail to satisfy the diverse needs of edge scenarios. [Methods] Starting from the SONiC, which is the mainstream open-source network operation, based on the container technology to realize the scheduling capabilities of network functions and the integration method of UPF, the cloud-native way to realize the integration of resource scheduling scheme of SONiC and UPF is explained. [Results] Based on this solution, the UPF is sinking to the programmable network device for unified scheduling and management in the edge scenario. The feasibility analysis of the mechanism is done. [Limitations] As the overall technical architecture of UPF edge scheduling based on programmable networks, it realizes the deployment and scheduling of UPF network elements on the edge side network equipment. How to realize remote management and how to build a deterministic network and achieve cloud-side collaborative computing resource management through this solution are still open issues to be solved. [Conclusions] The UPF edge dispatching scheme based on the programmable network can be widely used in the Internet of Things, Internet of Vehicles, smart cities, and other fields, further enhancing openness and computing power dispatching ability of the network on the edge side, and solving the edge-side practical problems such as lack of network connectivity and computing power faced by the intelligent industry.},

The introduction of cloud-native and other information cloud computing technologies has enabled the computing power network to be open to the upper-layer services. Combined with the latest cloud-native serverless model, this paper proposes a FaaS-oriented scheduling technology of computing network heterogeneous resource, puts forward an overall technical architecture and a heterogeneous computing power scheduling mechanism, and further proposes an overall platform functional architecture on this basis. Thus, it solves the problem that the ability of computing network is further open to the upper application through FaaS under the condition of heterogeneous computing network integration.}

  abstract = {[Objective] This paper introduces a network organization method for computing power network to satisfy business needs, which is able to flexibly schedule and allocate computing resources among clouds, networks, and edge devices. This approach aims to schedule and manage a wider range of computing resources in a unified framework. At the edge of the network, due to the large number of embedded devices and their different architectures, it is difficult for the existing resource scheduling methods to meet the demand of computing power. [Methods] Starting from the computing network architecture and based on the cloud-native resource scheduling mechanism, a lightweight, multi-cluster hierarchical edge resource scheduling scheme is described. [Results] Based on the lightweight cloud-native platform, we successfully manage and deploy a massive amount of hetero-architecture edge devices inside computing power networks in a unified framework. [Limitations] As a unified resource scheduling platform for front-end equipment in the “cloud, edge, and end” designed for computing power networks, it is important to solve the problems of implementing cloud-side collaboration, deploying artificial intelligence algorithms in front-end embedded clusters and making front-end equipment more autonomy. [Conclusions] The front-end embedded resource scheduling solution for computing power networks can be widely used in the Internet of Things, Internet of Vehicles, smart cities and other fields to improve the autonomous processing capabilities of the front-end equipment, and solve other practical problems such as the lack of innovation capabilities and insufficient supports in intelligent industry of China.},

  title={Microservice Fault Management Based on Service Mesh},
  journal={Information and Communications Technologies},

  abstract = {Due to the characteristics of loose coupling between components, good expansibility and strong autonomy within components, microservice has become a new solution for distributed service among the big companies. However, the architecture of microservices is complex and fault-prone. And the failures are related to dynamic interactions between microservice instance which are difficult to reproduce. What’s more, the stability of the microservice cluster is poor and a failure is easy to cause the entire cluster to crash. To overcome these challenges, this paper proposes a microservice fault management solution based on service mesh and selects the appropriate service mesh software. The distributed tracing, log collection and fault injection provided by service mesh has been used for fault management and this solution has been applied to a software which is built based on microservice. The result shows that the scheme can locate the fault in time and reduce the adverse effects of the fault.}

In 6G network, network trust is proposed as a complementary concept of net-work security. Compared with network security based on the presumption of guilt, network trust is designed based on the presump-tion of innocence to prove itself without network attack of threat. Finally, trust requirements in next generation network are analyzed with the trend of higher frequency spectrum, capital expenditure, operational expenditure, and multi-domain integrated, including random access network sharing, space-ground integrated network and massive connection Internet of Things.}

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
